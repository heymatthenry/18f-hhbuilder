# Running the coding exercise

Hi! Thanks for taking the time to look at my code sample.
The main parts of this assignment are just the `index.html` and `index.js`,
so all you really need is a browser to run them. However, there are some
npm packages required for testing so please install those:

```
npm i
```

After installing the packages, you can spin up a server with `npm start`,
and `npm test` will run the test suite. The tests run in headless Chrome.
